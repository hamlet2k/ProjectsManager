# ProjectsManager â€” TODO
_Last updated: 2025-09-26 18:57:24_

A single, living backlog for this project. Keep it terse and implementation-friendly. Check items off and move them between sections as we go.

> Source of truth for project docs remains `/docs/` in the repo. This file is for *work tracking*.

---

## Now (Top 5)
- [ ] **Document endpoints**: enumerate current routes in `app.py` with brief purpose; add to `/docs/project-flows.md`.
- [ ] **Blueprint refactor (plan)**: propose module layout, file moves, and migration of routes to Blueprints; produce diffs.
- [ ] **Data model review**: confirm `Project` fields and decide on `Task` entity; generate initial migration if adding `Task`.
- [ ] **Bootstrap in ChatGPT**: ensure the Projectâ€™s Instructions use the latest `projectsmanager-chat-bootstrap.md` (link here in chat).
- [ ] **CSRF & basic error pages**: verify CSRF enabled; add friendly 404/500 templates.

---

## Next (Shortlist)
- [ ] **Auth (scaffold)**: login/logout; protect create/edit/delete; add roles (optional).
- [ ] **.env config**: standardize config via `python-dotenv`; document in `/docs/project-context.md`.
- [ ] **UI polish**: introduce Bootstrap; unify form layout and flash messaging.
- [ ] **Search/filters**: add simple search by project name/status on list page.
- [ ] **Import/Export CSV**: minimal CSV export of projects; optional CSV import.
- [ ] **Hybrid sync design**: define selective sync of scopes/tasks, groups, and basic permissions; document flows in `/docs/project-flows.md`.
- [ ] **Wrappers research**: compare Electron (desktop) vs. Capacitor / Flutter (mobile); capture pros/cons & packaging steps in `/docs/project-context.md`.
- [ ] **AI voice prototype**: push-to-talk + STT selection; intent â†’ API mapping â†’ confirmation loop; log ambiguities and ask follow-ups.
- [ ] **API surface for AI**: ensure endpoints for projects/tasks/notes are idempotent and machine-friendly; draft a minimal OpenAPI or endpoints table.

## ðŸ§© Improvements

- [x] Refactor scopes page into a modular blueprint with supporting services. _(2025-10-02)_
- [ ] Add a menu always visible on top, when the screen has longer content than it can render, that dynamically displays all the sections on top; clicking on the sections scrolls down to the section.
- [ ] When scrolling down the page, collapse the filters into a pill that remains always on top beside the add new task floating component; when clicked, expand the filters floating on the top of the screen.
- [ ] Make the add tag floating on top of the screen always visible despite scrolling.
- [ ] Remember in local storage the last scope and set of filters applied by the user and automatically apply it when the user logs in (tags, search, completed tasks, sort).
- [ ] On the new task component, swap the position and styles of the save and cancel buttons.
- [ ] Make the add new task field expand in height when the content doesn't fit in the field.
- [ ] After adding a task with a tag, focus on the add new task field with the last tag already selected.
- [ ] After adding a task, scroll to the newly added tag.
- [ ] Add alt-text to the buttons that have a key bind associated.
- [ ] Define a good name to publish this project online.
- [ ] Create plans for online deployments.
- [ ] Create an import/export tasks functionality accessible from the navbar; it can auto-recognize imports in a JSONB format or comma-separated items. For exports, let the user choose the format. Export only entire sections displayed on screen, so the user must apply the right filtering before exporting.
- [ ] Export task to a GitHub issue.
- [ ] Add a copy icon on each task to copy the task (title, description, tags, etc.) to the clipboard.
- [ ] Rename the scopes to projects/groups/lists in the UI.
- [ ] Add a floating chevron icon visible only when the screen is scrolled down; when clicked, it scrolls to the top of the screen.
- [ ] Add a copy icon next to the quick add icon that copies all tasks within the group to the clipboard.
- [ ] Add a copy icon on scopes that copies all tasks within the scope to the clipboard.
- [ ] When refreshing the page or loading the scopes page, all last toast messages display again â€” they shouldnâ€™t.
- [ ] Select which icons should be displayed when the task is collapsed and which when it is expanded.
- [ ] Add an icon next to the quick add icon section to delete the entire category.
- [ ] Add a setting to copy tasks in plain text or JSONB format.
- [ ] Add a key shortcut to delete the value in the search field (Ctrl + Backspace).

## Backlog
- [ ] **Dockerfile & compose**: local DB + app service; document dev workflow.
- [ ] **Logging**: structured logs for create/update/delete operations.
- [ ] **Soft deletes (optional)**: decide policy; implement `deleted_at` if adopted.
- [ ] **CI smoke test**: GitHub Actions to run `flake8`/`pytest` (if tests exist) and `flask db upgrade`.
- [ ] **Project detail page**: show project with related tasks.
- [ ] **Role-based access**: owner/admin permissions for edit/delete.
- [ ] **Export data model diagram**: auto-generate ER from SQLAlchemy (optional).
- [ ] **Offline conflict resolution**: policy + UX; AI-assisted merge prompts when edits diverge.
- [ ] **Roles & permissions**: model access for local/cloud groups.
- [ ] **Packaging pipelines**: build scripts for desktop/mobile wrappers; env/config strategy.
- [ ] **Proactive assistant**: suggestions, blockers, and flow-changing prompts based on context.

## Done
- [x] **Split docs** into `project-context.md`, `project-flows.md`, `data-model.md`. _(2025-09-26)_
- [x] **Consolidate model/cost strategy** into ChatGPT bootstrap; remove `ai-project-prompt.md` from repo (pending PR). _(2025-09-26)_

---

## Decisions Log (brief)
- **Behavior/cost strategy** belongs in ChatGPT **bootstrap**, not repo docs.
- Repo docs are for IDE agents: context, flows, data model, history.

---

## Conventions
- Keep tasks **atomic**; aim for PRs that do one thing well.
- If a task changes models, include **migration** in the PR and update `/docs/data-model.md`.
- If routes/UX change, update `/docs/project-flows.md`.
- Always append a summary of meaningful changes to `/docs/ai-output-history.md`.

---

## AI Assistant Usage
Whenever a task involves code changes, provide BOTH:
1) **Paste-ready prompt** for the chosen tool (Copilot / Kilo Code / Coding Agent).  
2) **Code/diff snippets** in chat.

### Task Prompt Template (drop into your tool)
```
Project: ProjectsManager (Flask)

Load first:
- docs/project-context.md
- docs/ai-output-history.md
- docs/project-flows.md (if routes/UX change)
- docs/data-model.md (if models/migrations change)

Task:
<describe the concrete change>

Constraints:
- Flask-Migrate compatibility for any model change.
- Provide complete code blocks/diffs (no placeholders).
- Minimal, focused changes; PEP 8.

Deliverables:
1) Exact file diffs or full contents.
2) Brief rationale.
3) Migration commands (if any).
4) Entry text for docs/ai-output-history.md.
```
