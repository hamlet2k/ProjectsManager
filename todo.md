## Conventions
- Keep tasks **atomic**; aim for PRs that do one thing well.
- If a task changes models, include **migration** in the PR and update `/docs/data-model.md`.
- If routes/UX change, update `/docs/project-flows.md`.

---

## AI Assistant Usage
Whenever a task involves code changes, provide BOTH:
1) **Paste-ready prompt** for the chosen tool (Copilot / Kilo Code / Coding Agent).  
2) **Code/diff snippets** in chat.

### Task Prompt Template (drop into your tool)
```
Project: ProjectsManager (Flask)

Load first:
- docs/project-context.md
- docs/ai-output-history.md
- docs/project-flows.md (if routes/UX change)
- docs/data-model.md (if models/migrations change)

Task:
<describe the concrete change>

Constraints:
- Flask-Migrate compatibility for any model change.
- Provide complete code blocks/diffs (no placeholders).
- Minimal, focused changes; PEP 8.

Deliverables:
1) Exact file diffs or full contents.
2) Brief rationale.
3) Migration commands (if any).
```
